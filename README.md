### Philosophy

Eagle Swap is founded by blockchain geeks, business professionals who believe blockchain technology will have a massive impact on the future and change the landscape of technology in general.

We are committed to connecting businesses and consumers with the new digital economic infrastructure through tokenisation. Tokenised rights can be traded on the market and integrated across systems, forming a Frictionless Market and allowing limitless integration with the web.

We want to give businesses the whitelabel tools they need to develop their ethereum wallets, and join the tokenised economy.
